	<p class="about">
	I currently work as a <a href="http://www.courant.com/hc-sandra-gomez-aceves-20170109-staff.html">Breaking News Reporter</a> at the Hartford Courant in Connecticut, my home state. In May 2017, I completed my undergraduate degree at Southern Connecticut State University. I earned a B.S. in Journalism with a concentration in Political Science. In my spare time I enjoy adventures, taking pictures and playing with my puppy, Rex.</p>

I began as an intern on the metro desk and soon began helping with a company-wide video initiative. My reporting work at The Courant ranges widely, from metro to breaking news coverage:  -->
